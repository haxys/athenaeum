Exploring the world of dangerous code.

> "Every tool is a weapon, if you hold it right." ~Ani DiFranco, _My I.Q._

There's no getting rid of malware. Like the mythical hydra, for every strain we destroy, countless others arise in its place. Ever since [John Von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) published the [Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata](https://cba.mit.edu/events/03.11.ASE/docs/VonNeumann.pdf) in 1966, the state of the art of malware design has exploded in scope and complexity. Originally designed to ease our lives, computers have become weapons in the hands of unscrupulous threat actors.

ScriptSharks aims to document the art and history of malware design and analysis, in the hopes that this information will help defenders to understand and prevent malware attacks in the future. It is currently the work of a single author; as such, it will grow and expand along with the author's own knowledge and skill.
